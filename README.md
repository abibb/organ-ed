# organ-ed
We aim to increase government transparency and create a more cost-effective and secure way to store national transplant waiting list and organ sharing transactions by putting the organ sharing transactions onto private permissioned blockchain and making the transaction data public while hiding the patientâ€™s personal information. This project aims to create a web application-Organ Chain to track organ donation with blockchain technology. To achieve this we are using Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 which is a blockchain framework with private and  permissioned property. Participants in the system include organ donor, hospital, recipient, and UNOS. A donated organ is our asset and Organ Chains to resits movement around the system on our blockchain running on a blockchain network simulated by Hyperledger composer.
